README TO RUN MY ENSEMBLE:

-Within my code, you can see experiments split out into separate commented blocks.
-In order to run a specific experiments, just uncomment the block, set the file of interest in the 
FileStream() object and adjust other parameters accordingly.

-Each block has a comment just before explaining what the experiment is so that it is easier for you 
to identify. 

- Predefined directory location of the files must also be changed for successful replication.
